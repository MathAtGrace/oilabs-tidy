## Getting Started

### Load packages

In this lab, we will explore and visualize the data using the **tidyverse** suite of packages, and perform statistical inference using **infer**.
The data can be found in the companion package for OpenIntro resources, **openintro**.  We'll also use a new package called **janitor** that is really useful for creating two-way tables.

Remember to only do this code once in your console:
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("janitor", "gt", "vcd"))
```


Let's load the packages.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(infer)
library(janitor)
library(gt)
library(vcd)
```

### Creating a reproducible lab report

To create your new lab report, in RStudio, go to New File -\> R Markdown... Then, choose From Template and then choose `Lab Report for OpenIntro Statistics Labs` from the list of templates.

### The data

You will be analyzing the same dataset as in the previous lab, where you delved into a sample from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey, which uses data from high schoolers to help discover health patterns.
The dataset is called `yrbss` which comes with the `openintro` package.  You can check it out with

```{r eval = FALSE}
data(yrbss)
View(yrbss)
```

and you can see more of what the variable names mean by
```{r eval = FALSE}
?yrbss
```

### Exploring the data with tables

First we'll use the `janitor` package to create tables from our categorical data, then we'll use the `gt` package to make our tables pretty.  

1.  Run the code below in your lab report.  Make a mathematical observation about the data.  A "mathematical oberservation" means you should refer to at least one of the numbers.  Remember: your answers to lab reports should always be in complete sentences.

```{r }
yrbss %>%
  tabyl(text_while_driving_30d) %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  gt()
```


2.  You might be annoyed about the order of the groups in the table you made.  This is because R orders categories alphabetically, and `30` comes before `6` alphabetically because $3 < 6$.  We can fix this by manually changing the order of the categories.  Run the code below in your lab report and then rerun the code from exercise 1.

```{r}
yrbss <- yrbss %>%
  mutate(text_while_driving_30d = factor(text_while_driving_30d,
                                         levels = c("did not drive",
                                                    "0", "1-2", "3-5",
                                                    "6-9", "10-19",
                                                    "20-29", "30")),
         helmet_12m = factor(helmet_12m,
                             levels = c("did not ride", "never",
                                        "rarely", "sometimes",
                                        "most of time", "always")))
```

The `janitor` package let's us go a step further than using `count()` like in previous labs, because it can create 2-way tables, and then easily "adorn" them with totals, percentages, etc.

3.  Run the code below in your lab report.  Pick one of the non-total percentages and use it in a complete sentence that gives the context of that number.

```{r}
yrbss %>%
  tabyl(text_while_driving_30d, helmet_12m) %>%
  adorn_totals("row") %>%
  adorn_totals("col") %>%
  adorn_percentages("all") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  gt()
```

## Inference for Two Proportions

Do you think that people who always wear their helmet are more likely to not text and drive?

Our first problem with answering this question is that both of these questions have more than two options, so we need to recode each of them into only two categories.  We'll break this into steps.  Run this in your console and then look at the both variables to see that they are now only made up of two categories.

```{r view-two-proportions-view, eval=FALSE}
yrbss %>%
  select(text_while_driving_30d, helmet_12m) %>%
  mutate(text_while_driving_30d = ifelse(text_while_driving_30d == "0",
                                         "0", "not 0"),
         helmet_12m = ifelse(helmet_12m == "always",
                             "always", "not always")) %>%
  View()
```

Notice that we took the `yrbss` data and distilled it to two variables with two outcomes each as a new data set called `helmet_vs_no_texting`.  Think about how this was done, because you'll have to do it for two other variables later on.

Now that we have two variables with two possibilities each, we have a scenario that matches section 6.2 of our book on the difference of two proportions.

To find the point estimate we only need to add one line to the end of the code above.

```{r two-proportions, warning=FALSE}
yrbss %>%
  mutate(text_while_driving_30d = ifelse(text_while_driving_30d == "0",
                                         "0", "not 0"),
         helmet_12m = ifelse(helmet_12m == "always",
                             "always", "not always")) %>%
  prop_test(response = text_while_driving_30d,
            explanatory = helmet_12m,
            order = c("always", "not always"),
            z = TRUE)
```

1.  You should have received a warning that 1199 rows containing missing values were removed.  Thinking back to chapter 1, what is the name of the bias that we need to careful of committing? What percentage of our sample does this represent?

1.  Summarize what we just did by first writing the null and alternative hypothesis in words, then pasting the code chunk above, and finally, by writing a decision and conclusion based on the p-value you computed.

2.  Use complete sentences to interpret this confidence interval in context of the survey.

### On Your own: Difference of Two Proportions

Are males or females more likely to say they do not watch TV?

2.  Follow similar steps above to completet a hypothesis test to check whether gender and not watching TV are dependent or independent.  Make sure to state your null and alternative hypothesis in English, include your code, and interpret your decision and conclusion.

*Hint:* you should be able to copy/paste the code chunk above that computed a p-value and swap in new variable names and recode new categories to complete the problem above.  You don't need to recode `gender` because there are already only two categories.

1.  Follow similar steps above to find the confidence interval for the hours of TV watched by females minus the hours of TV watched by males on school nights.  Show your code and interpret your results in context of the data.


## Chi-Squared Test for Independence

When our categorical variables have more than one category we can use a Chi-squared test of fit for one variable (section 6.3 of the textbook) and a Chi-squared test of independence for two variables (section 6.4 of the textbook).

For example, can run a Chi-squared test for independence between how many hours students slept on school nights vs the number of hours they watched TV on school nights.  But first, let's give the categories a proper order.

```{r}
data("yrbss")
yrbss <- yrbss %>%
  mutate(hours_tv_per_school_day =
           ifelse(hours_tv_per_school_day == "do not watch",
                  "0", hours_tv_per_school_day),
         hours_tv_per_school_day =
           factor(hours_tv_per_school_day,
                  levels = c("0", "<1", "1",
                             "2", "3", "4",
                             "5+")),
         school_night_hours_sleep =
           factor(school_night_hours_sleep,
                  levels = c("10+", "9", "8",
                             "7", "6", "5",
                             "<5")))
```

We can run a chi-squared test on this data by creating a two-way table and then passing it to the function `chisq.test()`.

```{r chi-squared, warning=FALSE}
X2_sleep_vs_tv <- yrbss %>%
  tabyl(school_night_hours_sleep, hours_tv_per_school_day,
        show_na = FALSE) %>%
  chisq.test()
X2_sleep_vs_tv
```

When you ran the code chunk above, R did a lot of work that would have taken you a long time to do by hand.  By saving the chi-squared test above, we can run diagnostics by checking the observed, expected, and residuals $\text{res} = \frac{(O-E)^2}{E}$ for each combination of categories.

We can look at the observed values,

```{r}
X2_sleep_vs_tv$observed %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Observed") %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "Hours TV", columns = 2:8) %>%
  cols_label(school_night_hours_sleep = html("Hours<br>Sleep"))
```

the expected values,

```{r}
X2_sleep_vs_tv$expected %>%
  adorn_rounding() %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Expected") %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "Hours TV", columns = 2:8) %>%
  cols_label(school_night_hours_sleep = html("Hours<br>Sleep"))
```

and the residuals.

```{r}
X2_sleep_vs_tv$residuals %>%
  adorn_rounding() %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Residuals") %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "Hours TV", columns = 2:8) %>%
  cols_label(school_night_hours_sleep = html("Hours<br>Sleep"))
```


And we can visualize the distribution with a mosaic plot.  The rectangles are shaded red if they are smaller than expected, and blue if they are larger than expected.

```{r}
yrbss %>%
  mosaic(data = .,
         ~ hours_tv_per_school_day + school_night_hours_sleep,
         direction = c("v", "h"),
         shade = TRUE)
```

1.  Write out the null and alternative hypothesis for this Chi-squared test in English, then copy the code for the test and the mosaic plot, then write a decision and conclusion.

2.  Hopefully your conclusion is not too strong for the question above.  In order to say something stronger, we would have had to divide both variables into only two categories.  For future research, suggest a way of dividing each variable into only two categories based on the mosaic plot above.
